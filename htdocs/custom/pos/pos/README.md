Install
-------

### From the ZIP file and GUI interface

- If you get the module in a zip file (like when downloading it from the market place [Dolistore](https://www.dolistore.com)), go into
menu ```Home - Setup - Modules - Deploy external module``` and upload the zip file.


Note: If this screen tell you there is no custom directory, check your setup is correct: 

- In your PowerERP installation directory, edit the ```htdocs/conf/conf.php``` file and check that following lines are not commented:

    ```php
    //$powererp_main_url_root_alt ...
    //$powererp_main_document_root_alt ...
    ```

- Uncomment them if necessary (delete the leading ```//```) and assign a sensible value according to your PowerERP installation

    For example :

    - UNIX:
        ```php
        $powererp_main_url_root_alt = '/custom';
        $powererp_main_document_root_alt = '/var/www/PowerERP/htdocs/custom';
        ```

    - Windows:
        ```php
        $powererp_main_url_root_alt = '/custom';
        $powererp_main_document_root_alt = 'C:/My Web Sites/PowerERP/htdocs/custom';
